# What makes a computer a computer?

- scientists realised that machienes needs input, store information, process it and output the results.

# Input: 
- by interacting with your computer, phone, smart watch, ..etc you are giving them an input information.

## processing and storage:
- the pc cpu takes the information from the memory and it changes it using algorithm and send it back to memory again and the information is ready to be output.

### output:
- photos, messages, signals are all considered as output.

- computers are actually 1 and 0 , though it is only from the inside.
- the 1 is true and the 0 is false.
- Binary numbers only have two numbers 1 and 0 but you can count up to any number.
- photos, videos, sounds and texts are also considered 1 and 0.


### Circuits:
- circuits are considered an art form because you can shape it in many ways.. it only needs ideas.
- circuits are formed by millions of tiny components which come together to form a circuit.
- if the signal you give in was not the same as it goes out we call it "not"
- if we give the circuit a 1 and it went out with 1 then the circuit is called "and"
- when pressing the keyboard buttond.. thousands of 1 and 0 are being converted to pixels to show the letter on the screen.


#### CPU:
- the cpu controls all the operations in a computer.
- we never use 1 and 0 to type a command, but instead we use simpler commands that look like english.
